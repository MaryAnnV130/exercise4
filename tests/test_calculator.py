"""EXERCISE 1: testing existing code.

WHAT THIS IS
    The first exercise. `Calculator` in src/calculator.py already works. You
    are not writing it and you are not changing it. You are writing the tests
    that prove it does what it claims, which is the skill this module is
    about.

WHAT YOU DO HERE
    Cover all four methods, add(), subtract(), multiply() and divide(), with
    at least three test cases each: at least one normal input combination,
    and the borderline values at the edges of what a Python float can hold.
    What are the largest numbers you can add? What about the smallest?

THE TWO PARTS, AND PART 1 IS NOT OPTIONAL
    Part 1: write the test plan FIRST. Copy tasks/TEST_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md,
        rename your copy (test-plan.md will do), and fill in a row per case:
        ID, method, description, inputs, expected output, actual output. The
        plan is the exercise. Deciding what "correct" means before you can
        see what the code returns is the whole point.
    Part 2: turn each row of that plan into a test down here, then fill in
        the Actual output column from what you saw. Where actual differs from
        expected you have either found a defect or mis-stated your
        expectation, and both are worth writing down.

HOW THE TODOs WORK
    Every test still to be written carries @unittest.skip, so the suite is
    green on a fresh clone and the skip count is your progress bar. To do one:
    delete the @unittest.skip line above it, then replace `pass` with your
    arrange / act / assert. JUnit spells that marker @Disabled("reason").

HOW TO RUN
    From the repository root, the whole suite:
        python -m unittest discover
    Just this file:
        python -m unittest tests.test_calculator
    One test by name:
        python -m unittest tests.test_calculator.CalculatorTest.test_add_returns_the_sum_of_two_small_numbers
    Add -v to any of those to see one line per test with the skip reasons.

THE FULL BRIEF
    tasks/01_testing_existing_code.md

THE FRAMEWORK
    unittest, from the Python standard library. It is the closest thing
    Python has to JUnit: a TestCase class holding test methods, setUp instead
    of @BeforeEach, and assertEqual / assertTrue / assertRaises instead of the
    JUnit assertions. There is nothing to install.

class CalculatorTest(unittest.TestCase):
    """The JUnit CalculatorTest class, in Python.

    Every method whose name starts with `test_` is a test. JUnit finds tests
    by the @Test annotation; unittest finds them by that name prefix, so
    there is nothing to import and nothing to forget. Tests run in
    alphabetical order and each one gets its own fresh instance of this
    class, so nothing you set in one test can leak into another.

    Name your own tests the way these are named:
    test_method_scenario_expectedresult.
    """

    def setUp(self):
        """THE FIXTURE. Runs before EVERY test method in this class.

        This is exactly JUnit's @BeforeEach, same job and same timing, and
        unittest's tearDown is JUnit's @AfterEach (nothing here needs one).
        Build the object under test here and hang it on `self`, so every test
        starts from an identical, clean object and no test can be affected by
        one that ran before it.

        Calculator holds no state between calls, so a fresh one is not
        strictly needed here, but building the object under test in the
        fixture is the habit to get into: exercise 2's UserService does hold
        state, and there it is what stops the tests interfering.
